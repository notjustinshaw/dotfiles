* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) for fuzzy file/buffer/tag finding.

  Rails file structure via `gf` and `:A` (alternate), `:Rextract` partials,
  `:Rinvert` migrations, etc.
* Run many kinds of tests [from vim]([https://github.com/janko-m/vim-test)
* Set `<leader>` to a single space.
* Switch between the last two files with space-space.
* Syntax highlighting for Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Elixir, more.
* Use [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) instead of Grep when
  available.
* Map `<leader>ct` to re-index ctags.
* Use [vim-mkdir](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-mkdir) for automatically
  creating non-existing directories before writing the buffer.
* Use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage plugins.

[tmux](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course)
configuration:

* Improve color resolution.
* Remove administrative debris (session name, hostname, time) in status bar.
* Set prefix to `Ctrl+s`
* Soften status bar color from harsh green to light gray.

[git](http://git-scm.com/) configuration:

* Adds a `create-branch` alias to create feature branches.
* Adds a `delete-branch` alias to delete feature branches.
* Adds a `merge-branch` alias to merge feature branches into master.
* Adds an `up` alias to fetch and rebase `origin/master` into the feature
  branch. Use `git up -i` for interactive rebases.
* Adds `post-{checkout,commit,merge}` hooks to re-index your ctags.
* Adds `pre-commit` and `prepare-commit-msg` stubs that delegate to your local
  config.
* Adds `trust-bin` alias to append a project's `bin/` directory to `$PATH`.

Shell aliases and scripts:

* `c` for `clear`.
* `g` with no arguments is `git status` and with arguments acts like `git`.
* `mcd` to make a directory and change into it.
* `replace foo bar **/*.rb` to find and replace within a given list of files.
* `tat` to attach to tmux session named the same as the current directory.
* `v` for `$VISUAL` (currently an alias for vim).
* `ga` for `git add --all`.
* `gc <msg>` for `git commit -m "<msg>" (can use without quotes).
* `gp` for `git push`.
